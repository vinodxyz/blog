title: Apps with Maps
---

This project was a part of Thematic cartography and geovisualization.  
The idea is to have an app with a map, as the primary interface.  
Detailed-brief can be found [here](https://github.com/mapschool/course/issues/31)  

My idea was mainly based on [Causr](http://causr.rusic.com), which helps people with similar professional interests to connect with each other. [Causr's](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/causr) founder strongly [believes](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/causr-new-app-encourages-friendships-working-relationships-strangers/) in Serendipity and that Causr has 2 primary use-cases:  
1. Freelancers, that are looking for projects
2. People on their way to work, to connect to others in similar/related domains

Additionally, for other simpler tasks, such as:
* Splitting fares for a taxi to a common destination, or
* Ordering a pizza, hmmm

### Competitors
1\. [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) lists events happening on a 30km radius, on the basis of categories.
Primarily a list-based interface with 2 groups of events: trending and free/paid.

User can either choose their area of interest and find relevant events.  
Or, feel lucky and search for all events. Either ways, this interface lacks a map as its entry point.

2\. [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) is based on a similar concept.

However, it does have a map with dots as the visual encoding.  
Selecting a dot displays a card with the event's details.

3\. [Cityhour](http://cityhour.com/) is very similar to Causr.  
Unfortunately, I don't own an iphone and couldn't test this app.

### UX process
I was a little lost and needed a little inspiration. 
Lo and behold, Juhi's excellent [write-up](http://juhi.co/hike/) on the design-process behind several Hike's features gave me a lot of insights and ideas.

Jotting down the **user-flow** and **feature-list**, for the new app:
