title: Apps with Maps
---

This project was a part of Thematic cartography and geovisualization.  
The idea is to have an app with a map, as the primary interface.  
Detailed-brief can be found here  

My idea was mainly based on [Causr](causr.rusic.com), which helps people with similar professional interests to connect with each other.  
[Causr's](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/causr) founder strongly [believes](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/causr-new-app-encourages-friendships-working-relationships-strangers/) in Serendipity and that Causr has 2 primary use-cases:  
1. Freelancers, that are looking for projects
2. People on their way to work, to connect to others in similar/related domains

Additionally, for other simpler tasks, such as:
* Splitting fares for a taxi to a common destination, or
* Ordering a pizza, hmmm

### Competitors
Naturally, as a part of the design-process, we need to know what others in this area are upto:
1. [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) lists events happening on a 30km radius, on the basis of categories.
Primarily a list-based interface and 2 types of events: trending and free/paid.
