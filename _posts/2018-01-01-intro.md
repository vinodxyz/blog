A place for me to share about all things: design, data and dev related.  
During a project, I often come across good examples of visualizations and interfaces. These are often lost in an ocean of bookmarks and lacking my point of view.  Not any more !

## Cartography
As I'm writing this post, anxious thoughts are racing through my head.  
I've 2 presentations due tomorrow: [Narrative cartography](https://github.com/mapschool/course/issues/30) and [Apps with maps](https://github.com/mapschool/course/issues/31).  
This blog could serve as a place to document my research and ideas, as well.
