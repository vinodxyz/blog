title: Maps - Lots of readings

As a part of Cartography, we were exposed to tonnes of fascinating examples.  
Here are a few worth mentioning.

* [The Genius of the London Tube Map](https://www.facebook.com/SmallThingBigIdea/videos/1328242957321729/)  
Notable are the 3 principles of design: Focus, Simplicity and Cross Discipline approach. 

* Schematic Map
We also had an assignment to create a schematic-map for tourist-places, at our hometown.  
I created one for Mangalore, which is available on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalore#/media/File:Mangalore_Tourist_Map.png).  

* [Twisted tracks](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/27/twisted-tracks-metro-maps-real-life-geography-visualised)    
A look at how metro-maps are distorted from geography. Interesting were the decisions to places certain station-routes vertical when they seemed to be horizontal geographically. Guardian has few other [map-based datavizs](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/exploring-urban-data).

* For inspiration  
Check out examples of map styles and data-visualizations, on Rasagy's [pinterest](https://in.pinterest.com/rasagy/for-the-love-of-maps/) and one of my [own](https://in.pinterest.com/vinodxyz/cartography/).

* [Indian Railway Network](http://ruchikavn.github.io/indianrailwaymap)  
Loved the hierarchy in displaying rail-routes: If you zoom out sufficiently, routes connecting only major stations are shown (a very high-level overview). Zooming further reveals more routes and finally all stations with their labels (deatiled view). Truly love how information start popping up on incrementing zoom-levels.  
Selecting a station further reveals its reach to subsequent locations. Metaphorically, it feels like a circulatory-system transporting blood-cells around. The filters also kick-ass revealing connectivity via different trains. Only hiccup I faced was when the hue used for Passenger & Mail trains are dominated by the existing yellow-ish hue. This makes it a tad bit difficult to "read" these rail-routes.

* [Ooru](http://ooru.in/)  
Cartography also exposed us to geo-political and sociological stands, that're taken by the community against a government initiative.  
[Ooru](http://ooru.in:3000/) which enables Bangaloreans to be a part of the BDA Masterplan for Bangalore in 2030. An overlay of the existing and proposed version of Master-plans of various areas in Bangalore on a satellite-view. This tool enables one to post comments at any location after making suitable analysis. Minus this wonderful tool, this level of audit would be simply not possible. 

* [Speak For Me](https://www.speakforme.in/mp/?lang=en)  
Recently, everyone has been plagued with Aadhar-link related messages across all platforms. SpeakForMe was built to enable people to petition against this, directly with your concerned MP, with a simple interface. Notable was [Neta-filter](http://netafilter.in/) that visualizes the education/assets/criminal cases of all MPs across India. Right off the bat, we get a clearer picture of who's governing. [P.S: Check out those huge orange circles in Maharasthra, what do they tell you?]

* [ichangemycity](https://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/map/mapcomplaints/)  
Submit compliants about the City's infrastructure. Switch to the map-based interface to reveal areas riddled with most complaints and the areas that are awesome to live in.  

* [A billion ways of seeing Mumbai](http://akshaykore.github.io/mumdata/about.html)  
This website revealed to me the importance of dataviz in aggregating multiple scattered datasets revealed by government and effectively communicate insights to the public, in a very simple way. Add a few datasets on this tool and start exploring. 

* [Maps <3 Data](https://speakerdeck.com/rasagy/maps-data-a-voyage-across-the-world-of-geo-visualization)  
A talk by Rasagy on geovisualization: their types, benefits and examples proved very useful and would be shaping a lot of our projects, this semester.  

* [Event Registry](http://eventregistry.org/search?type=articles)  
Use map to view news at a particular location. Quite nifty, when the bubble size and color, inform the reader of a potential "breaking" news. This also reminds me of a project by [Jibin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/52516929/UXUI-Concept-for-Google-News).  

* [Isochrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map)  
Came across this dataviz-type based on travel-times. Is it a heat map?  
Usage of [isochrones](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWSZkt-BqbJ/?taken-by=rasagy.sharma) in finding duration for accessing no of jobs via Majestic

* [Longest straight land path on Earth](https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/whacky-map-shows-longest-straight-path-earth/)  
Passiong through 9 Timezones and 18 countries, sounds like quite a walk. Notable is the curved path on a Mercator projection.  

* [Types of projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections)  
[XKCD](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/977:_Map_Projections), [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/29cddc0006f8b98eff12e60dd08f59a7) have had their takes on various projections of earth. Interested? Check out Kai's [Comparing Map Projections](https://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/ba569633d51ebec6ec6e) and Morten's [Morphing Map Projections](http://bl.ocks.org/mortenjohs/4739921). Also, another interesting [read](https://mapzen.com/blog/escape-from-mercator/) explains pitfalls with the Mercator projection and shows experimental web-maps with various projections, courtesy of Tangram.
